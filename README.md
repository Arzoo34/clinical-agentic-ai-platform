# NEST2.0_Hackathon
An AI-powered, insight-driven platform that unifies clinical and operational trial data in real time. It detects data quality issues, predicts operational risks, and automates monitoring using generative and agentic AI to enable faster, smarter, and proactive clinical trial decision-making.
# Problem Statement 
Integrated Insight-Driven Data-Flow Model for Clinical Trials


🔍 Problem Description


Clinical trials generate large volumes of data from multiple sources, such as:

Electronic Data Capture (EDC) systems

Laboratory test results

Site performance and operational metrics

Monitoring and audit logs

Currently, this data:

Exists in separate systems (silos)

Is reviewed manually

Reaches decision-makers very late

Causes delays, errors, and higher operational risk

Because of this fragmented data flow:

Data quality issues are detected too late

Operational bottlenecks remain hidden

Clinical Trial Teams (CTTs), Clinical Research Associates (CRAs), and trial sites lack real-time visibility
